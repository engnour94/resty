In phase 2, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service GET requests

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve itâ€™s data
As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format
